<h2>Serialization and Deserialization process.</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Serialization and deserialization are processes used to 
convert data between different forms. Serialization is the 
process of converting an object into a format that can be 
easily stored or transmitted, while deserialization is the 
reverse process of converting the serialized data back into 
an object.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<span style="font-size: 16px">Persistence:</span>
<span>Serialized data can be saved to a file or database, 
allowing for easy data storage and retrieval.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px">Communication:</span> 
<span>Serialized data can be transmitted over a network, 
enabling data exchange between different systems.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px">Efficiency:</span>
<span>Serialization simplifies the process of saving and 
loading complex data structures.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px">Flexibility:</span>
<span>Supports various formats like JSON, XML, and binary, 
allowing for interoperability between different systems and
languages.</span>

<h3>Mechanism</h3>

<p>Serialization involves converting an object's state into 
a byte stream, while deserialization involves reconstructing
the object from the byte stream. In Java, this is typically
done using the Serializable interface.</p>
